**Project 1**  
For a description of the instructions of project 1, see the instructor repository [here](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1). The source data is quite large and exceeds GitHub's file size limitations, but can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) as originally sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).


**Project 2**  
*Note 2/3/21: Project 2 details coming soon!*
